My name is Sara Al-Hindi. I'm currently based in Sacrameto, California but I often move.

I left University after my second year, initially thinking I was taking a small break. I went in for Communications, really interested in the mediation subject. I left San Francisco State and began thinking about what I could peacefully accomplish in life. 

It's been more than a couple years since I've left school now. I've always had an interest in coding but didn't dive into learning fundamentals until I found Flatirons Bootcamp Prep.

I'm excited to learn about all the creative endeavors I can pursure with the knowledge I will obtain from this program.
Newtworking will be a challenge for me but I'm confident in the resources provided and the cohort is incredibly friendly and easy to warm up to so I better open up!

So far, coding feels fun and challnging, and I can't wait to see what's ahead and how it will change my life.
