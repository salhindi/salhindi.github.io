My CLI project started out in a different spot than it ended. Finding a scrapable site that provided information I was interested in was important to me. I looked through the EA website, and several art websites. I decided to create a CLI that can help users discover their favorite types of artists in my local area, Sacramento County. 

Learning to scrape a dropdown menu was the initial challenge. Once I was able to move past that, I needed to find a way to iterate over each Artist type and return the artists associated with that type. I changed what I was scraping and needed to learn how to specify the specific page were are grabbing data from. Creating an interpolation with the atrribute name of each Artist Type and instilling it into the url page that I was scraping was a cool trick to learn! 

The CLI builds were incredibily helpful and thorough! Even though I got stuck in moments and felt like I had reached an impossible dead-end, I'd keep trying things and it'd work out! I learned I need to slow down, a lot of the errors I ran into could've been prevented if I paid closer attention to what I was typing instead of rushing to check a solution I may have thought of or learned about. 

 I want to add more information associated with the artist's contact info so the user may eventually pull that data as well. 
This project was eye-opening and incredibily fun. However, I need to set up a local environment ASAP because the IDE refresh is a lot of pressure.
